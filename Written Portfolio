Kinswinds – A card game based around passing cards to other players and creating a
“meta” that you can benefit from.

Pros
- Very dynamic and fast-paced, allows for replayability as a new meta can be created
  every time.
- Perfect party game, but also if players learn how other players play, they can then play
  around it, and then play around a new meta, and a new meta.
- Because of the cards’ simplicity, it’s easy to learn and easy to teach, making it have a low
  skill floor but a high skill ceiling due to the number of variables.
Cons
- Although there’s a lot of replayability, there isn’t much variety. Some people might be
  okay with that, of course.
- A bigger issue is that it is hard to play with fewer than 4 players due to the nature of such
  games.
- Another issue that can arise is teaming up on a player, due to communication being a
  factor.

Changes I’d Make:
  The only real change I would make (which I wouldn’t make, as the game is high quality already) is
  adding one or two extra cards and then balancing around them. However, more time would then
  have to be spent balancing that. Therefore, the number of cards is quite appropriate already.

Heart of Darkness - Zombicide Alternative game
Game about using your character to move around the board,
exploring figurative areas, and gaining abilities and items. These tools help you defeat
creatures that emerge from the darkness, trying to reach the “heart of darkness.”
Meanwhile, players are also searching for a way to escape the island they are protecting.
(Think Zombicide, but with fewer zombies and a stricter central goal.)

Pros
- The game has an easy-to-understand loop, but requires thoughtful planning to
  move efficiently and effectively.
- Finding ways to use items—either to slow enemies down or eliminate them—is
  engaging.
- It’s very satisfying to create a strategy, and even more rewarding when the team
  executes it successfully.
- The art is well done, adding to the immersion.
- The characters are designed with impact in mind; while some are stronger than
  others, most feel meaningful and distinct.
Cons
- Strategies, while satisfying, often feel clunky in execution.
- The amount of randomness—through dice rolls and item draws—can create
  frustrating situations.
- For example, failing to get the right items to escape or the right ones to
  defeat stronger monsters feels bad.
- Monsters are also random, though they do scale in diƯiculty.

Things I Would Change
In my honest opinion, the game would benefit from a serious redesign to improve overall
gameplay. Some starting points:
1. Board Design
- Make the board larger and more impactful to increase movement options
  and create more interesting positioning decisions.
2. Combat System
- Reduce reliance on randomness by replacing dice-based combat with a
  different system.
- This would add complexity and length, which may or may not align with
  the game’s intended direction.
3. Win Conditions
- Consider focusing the game more on survival over a set number of turns,
  rather than juggling multiple win conditions.
- This would simplify balance and give teams a clearer, more consistent
  goal each session.

Downside: 
  This approach might reduce replayability.
Possible Solution: 
  Add more maps, variable scenarios, or diƯiculty scaling options.

Final Thoughts-
  Ultimately, the direction depends on the intended final product. Each change has tradeoƯs, and adjustments will likely increase development time. The key question is whether
  the game should lean toward deeper strategy with less randomness, or remain a lighter,
  more chaotic experience.

Gunpowder – A Fast-Paced Social Deduction Game
Gunpowder is a social deduction game themed around Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot.
Players take on hidden roles being Plotters (town), Traitors, and Neutrals.
They race against a timer to either successfully arm enough bombs or sabotage the plot by causing bombs to fail. 
The core loop revolves around drawing and playing material cards, where correct combinations help assemble bombs, and incorrect ones generate paranoia, making future rounds more difficult.
While similar in spirit to Werewolf and other deduction titles, Gunpowder stands out due to its unique pacing, card-driven mechanics, and thematic focus.

Pros
- Fast-paced and easy to grasp: The gameplay loop is simple and accessible,
  making it very easy to teach and onboard new players.
- Clean character design: Roles are straightforward, reducing downtime or 
  confusion and keeping the table energy high.
- Deck mechanics that add variety: Special cards introduce twists without disrupting the game's
  speed or forcing rulebook checks, thanks to the strict timer.
- A unique thematic niche: Very few social deduction games explore this historical theme,
  giving Gunpowder a fresh identity in a crowded genre.
- Strong short-term entertainment value: Across the first ~10 sessions, the game remains lively
  and engaging before potential repetition sets in.

Cons
- Major balance issues: As with many social deduction games, Gunpowder struggles with low player counts.
  Anything below 4–5 players becomes extremely difficult to balance.
- Low complexity for a deduction game: Since actions are easy to track, attentive players can often
  “solve” the game through memory and simple logic.
- Binary outcomes: Rounds often devolve into 50/50 judgments, where an innocent player may be eliminated for the group to succeed.
- Polarizing gameplay: Depending on small rule variations, games tend to skew heavily in favor of either the
  Plotters or the Traitor, with little middle ground.
- Neutral role complications: Neutrals often destabilize balance, effectively adding an extra player
  to one side’s win condition.

Things I Would Change

Increase the minimum player count
  Raising the requirement to six players would bring Gunpowder closer to standard social deduction design, allowing more 
  consistent role distribution and reducing the dominance of logic-based “solves.”
Rebalance roles and objectives
- Adjusting Plotter abilities, bomb requirements, or the overall time limit would 
  help keep the game competitive across its roles.
- The goal should be ensuring both Plotters and Traitors have meaningful
  agency without one side snowballing early.
Rework or remove the Neutral
- Neutrals should only appear in higher player-count games, and their design  
  must reinforce genuine neutrality.
- In smaller groups, the Neutral role adds swingy advantages that can break the 
  game in one side’s favor.

Final Thoughts

Gunpowder offers a refreshing take on social deduction, driven by speed, simplicity, and a distinctive theme. 
However, its balance issues and low complexity limit its longevity and strategic depth.
With adjustments to role structure, player counts, and objective design, the game could evolve into a more robust and competitive experience. 
Ultimately, the choice is whether Gunpowder should lean into being a quick, chaotic party game or push toward tighter,
more strategic deduction gameplay—with each direction requiring deliberate tuning.

Cannibal World – A Card Battler Without Mana
Cannibal World is a card-battling game built around a point-based deck-construction system rather than traditional mana or energy curves.
Players create a deck of 15–25 cards using a 160-point budget, choosing from four distinct classes: Dogs (aggressive rush), Cats and Rejects (two different midrange archetypes), and Rats (small-unit control and swarm disruption).
Once the deck is built, players face off by generating 4 meat each turn—a universal resource used for playing cards, attacking, and activating abilities. 
Victory is achieved either by exhausting the opponent’s deck or by successfully ransacking them three times when their board is empty.

Pros
- Easy to learn, quick to onboard
  The rules are simple on the surface, allowing even players with no card-game experience to start playing within minutes.
- High skill ceiling 
  Deckbuilding depth allows players to refine strategies and exploit synergies efficiently, rewarding optimization and punishing weaker constructions.
- Fast matches and strong replayability
  Games are short and can be played back-to-back, and the combination of four classes and many card interactions keeps sessions feeling varied.
- Four distinct playstyles
  Each class offers different tactical approaches, giving players room to experiment and find the archetype that suits them but enough cards to allow variabilty between decks.

Cons
- A dominant meta emerged quickly
  Althougth it might be due to poor testing from main development on core, certain classes consistently rose above the rest—Dogs during the core release and Rejects
  during the expansion but were not patched or balanced causing more difficulty in next expansion testing
- Rule clarity issues
  Many interactions weren’t intuitive and required frequent clarification, partly due to the game’s experimental mechanics and atypical resource system.
- Fun decks struggled against meta lists
  Because of the small deck sizes (and the fact that nearly all cards are drawn every game), off-meta or thematic decks rarely had a viable win path.
- Point-based deckbuilding was cumbersome
  Building precisely to 160 points felt fiddly, slowing down the deck creation process and making experimentation much harder.

Overall Thoughts

Cannibal World delivered an enjoyable experience for the entire test group, and over time, the game moved toward a much more balanced state.
Many problematic cards received adjustments, and by the end of testing most classes felt viable—though Rejects continued to stand out in tactics, likely due to their extremely efficient meat-to-value ratio.
Almost all desired improvements were either forwarded to the developer or implemented directly, including balance fixes and reworks for underperforming cards.
As a result, there are few additional changes to suggest beyond what was already addressed.
Ultimately, Cannibal World succeeded as a fast, clever, and distinctive card battler, even if certain systems remained rough around the edges that will be cleared with better rule writing.
